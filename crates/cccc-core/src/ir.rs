//! The language-agnostic intermediate representation (IR) that the complexity
//! engine scores.
//!
//! A language adapter (e.g. `cccc-typescript`) lowers its native AST into a
//! `Vec<Node>` describing only the constructs that affect Cognitive / Cyclomatic
//! Complexity — branches, loops, switches, exception handlers, logical-operator
//! sequences, function boundaries, and calls. Everything else collapses into
//! [`Node::Group`], which is a transparent container the engine simply recurses
//! into. All scoring rules live in [`crate::engine`]; the IR carries no scores.
//!
//! The top level handed to the engine is itself a `&[Node]`, representing
//! module-level code; the engine scores it under an implicit module frame.
